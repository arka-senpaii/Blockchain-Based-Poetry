# Blockchain-Based Poetry

## Project Description
This smart contract enables users to write and store poems on the blockchain. Each poem is permanently stored on-chain, ensuring immutability and proof of ownership.

## Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant platform for poets. By storing poems on the blockchain, we ensure their preservation and provide an open, fair platform for literary expression.

## Future Scope
- **NFT Integration**: Convert poems into NFTs for ownership and monetization.
- **Poem Rating System**: Allow users to like and comment on poems.
- **Author Rewards**: Implement a system to reward poets based on community engagement.
- **Decentralized Publishing**: Provide options for poets to share their work across different platforms.

## Key Features
- **Write & Store Poems**: Users can write poems and store them permanently on-chain.
- **Immutable Storage**: Poems are stored in a tamper-proof manner.
- **Ownership Tracking**: Each poem is linked to its author's Ethereum address.
- **Poem Retrieval**: Any user can retrieve poems by index.
